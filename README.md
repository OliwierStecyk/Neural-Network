# Neural-Network
This repository contains a step-by-step implementation of a neural network built entirely from scratch in Python using only NumPy. It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how neural networks work “under the hood” — including forward propagation, backpropagation, gradient descent, and weight updates.
